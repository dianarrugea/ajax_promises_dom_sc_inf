# Homework - Ajax, promises and DOM manipulation

* We'd like to use the API provided by https://www.themealdb.com/api.php (specifically Filter by main ingredient and Lookup full meal details by id) to implement a UI that is similar to the one you can see in the below pictures.

* On search we should request the following URL www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient-name} to receive the recipes which contain the ingredient we searched for - {ingredient-name} would then be replaced by the ingredient in the search bar i.e www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=chicken_breast or www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=egg

* On "Get recipe" button we should request the following URL www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i={id} to receive the extended data for the selected recipe - {id} would then be replaced by the selected recipe id i.e https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=52772


* The homework should contain one HTML, one CSS and one JS file. 
* Put those files into one archive. Name the archive using the following pattern: your-name-js-ajax-dom-homework.
